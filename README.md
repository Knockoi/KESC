## New Update !!  
![image]([https://github.com/Knockoi/KESC/image/2025-11-11%20202442.png)  
I’m currently trying to place the two boards side-by-side to reduce the overall width. I also recently learned how JLCPCB’s pricing scales with board area, so I’m planning to shrink the design to within 50 × 50 mm to keep prototyping costs lower. I’m still exploring better layout options, and I’m considering trying an “Apple-style” PCB design approach, which might help make the routing cleaner and more organized.

> Sorry for the late update — most of my time recently has been going into the E-Stick
 project. If you’re interested, I’d really appreciate your support there as well.

The system board design is pending finalization of the power board layout.
